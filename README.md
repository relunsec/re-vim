## ‚ú® Project Overview: Your Ultimate RE-Vim Setup

Welcome to the **Relun RE-Vim Setup**, a powerful automation script designed to transform your Vim editor into a robust, feature-rich environment specifically tailored for **reverse engineering (RE)** and **malware analysis**. This script streamlines the tedious process of configuring Vim with essential plugins, custom syntax highlighting, and integrated command-line tools, allowing you to focus on the intricate details of binary analysis.

Whether you're examining firmware, dissecting executables, or exploring system calls, this setup provides a unified, efficient workspace right within your favorite text editor.

## üöÄ Features

This script configures Vim with the following powerful capabilities:

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Plugin Management:** Automatically installs **vim-plug**, making it easy to manage your Vim plugins.
* **üîå Essential RE Plugins:** Includes and configures:
    * **r2.vim:** Seamless integration with **Radare2** for powerful binary analysis.
    * **NERDTree:** A tree explorer plugin for navigating your file system.
    * **vim-polyglot:** Extensive language support for various programming languages.
    * **vim-airline:** A sleek and informative status bar.
    * **Tagbar:** An outline explorer for source code.
* **üåâ GhidraBridge Integration:** Clones and sets up **GhidraBridge**, enabling potential scripting and interaction with Ghidra from within Vim (requires Ghidra and GhidraBridge setup).
* **üåà Binwalk Syntax Highlighting:** Custom syntax highlighting for `binwalk` output, making it easier to read and analyze firmware/file system extractions.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Analysis Tools (Key Mappings):** Access common RE tools directly from Vim:
    * `<Leader>b`: Run **Binwalk** on the current file and open output in a new buffer.
    * `<Leader>r`: Open **Radare2** on the current file in a terminal split.
    * `<Leader>s`: Open a new **Shell terminal** split (for general command execution).
    * `<Leader>o`: Run **Objdump -d** on the current file and show disassembly.
    * `<Leader>h`: Run **Hexdump -C** on the current file for byte-level inspection.
    * `<Leader>t`: Run **Strings** on the current file.
    * `<Leader>g`: Run **GDB** on the current file in a terminal split.
    * `<Leader>x`: Run **Strace** on the current file (output to `/tmp/strace_output.txt` and displayed).
    * `<Leader>l`: Run **Ltrace** on the current file (output to `/tmp/ltrace_output.txt` and displayed).
    * `<Leader>f`: Run **`file`** command on the current file to identify file type.
    * `<Leader>e`: Run **Strings with addresses** (`strings -a -t x`) on the current file.
    * `<Leader>c`: Run **`checksec`** on the current file to analyze security mitigations.
    * `<Leader>d`: Run **`readelf -a`** for full ELF header and section details.
    * `<Leader>i`: Run **`rabin2 -I`** for binary info (Radare2 family).
    * `<Leader>n`: Run **`rabin2 -S`** for section information (Radare2 family).
    * `<Leader>y`: Check for **GNU_RELRO** using `readelf`.
    * `<Leader>v`: Run **`ldd`** to show shared library dependencies.
    * `<Leader>z`: Run **`readelf -h`** for ELF header details.
    * `<Leader>s` (redefined): Interactive **Regexp Search** within the current buffer.
    * `<Leader>cy`: Open **CyberChef** in your default browser.
    * `<Leader>cy` (redefined): Calculate **SHA256Sum** of the current file and display it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up your RE-focused Vim environment, simply run the Python script:

1.  **Ensure Vim is installed** on your system.
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install vim curl git
    # For Fedora
    sudo dnf install vim curl git
    # For Arch
    sudo pacman -S vim curl git
    ```
2.  **Download the script:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/relunsec/re-vim.git](https://github.com/relunsec/re-vim.git)
    cd re-vim
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 re_vim.py
    ```

The script will:
* Install `vim-plug`.
* Clone `ghidra_bridge`.
* Create Binwalk syntax highlighting.
* Generate/update your `~/.vimrc` with all the custom functions and key mappings.
* Install all listed Vim plugins.

### Prerequisites

* **Vim:** Your primary editor.
* **Curl:** For downloading `vim-plug`.
* **Git:** For cloning repositories.
* **Python 3:** To run the setup script.
* **Standard RE Tools:** `binwalk`, `radare2`, `objdump`, `hexdump`, `strings`, `gdb`, `strace`, `ltrace`, `file`, `checksec`, `readelf`, `rabin2`, `ldd`. Ensure these are installed and in your system's PATH for the Vim functions to work correctly.
